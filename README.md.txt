## Overview

This project analyzes how different types of educational support (family support, school support, paid tutoring) and extracurricular activities affect student performance in Math and Portuguese. The analysis uses data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).

## Objectives

- Understand the effect of support and activities on student grades.
- Compare findings between Math and Portuguese.
- Provide recommendations for educators and policymakers.
